            The Myers Briggs Type Indicator
        </h1>
        <p>
        Based largely on the work of Carl Jung's theories of psychological types, the test was developed by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers-Briggs in World War II.
        It was developed to simplify Jung's work into a simple test for practical uses for role assignment in the war. The 16 types are typically referred to by an 
        abbreviation of four letters, the initial letters of each of their four type preferences (except in the case of intuition, which uses the abbreviation "N" to
        distinguish it from introversion). For instance:

        ENTJ: extraversion (E), intuition (N), thinking (T), judgment (J)
        ISFP: introversion (I), sensing (S), feeling (F), perception (P)
