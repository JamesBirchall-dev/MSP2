            The Myers Briggs Type Indicator
        </h1>
        <p>
        Based largely on the work of Carl Jung's theories of psychological types, the test was developed by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers-Briggs in World War II.
        It was developed to simplify Jung's work into a simple test for practical uses for role assignment in the war. The 16 types are typically referred to by an 
        abbreviation of four letters, the initial letters of each of their four type preferences (except in the case of intuition, which uses the abbreviation "N" to
        distinguish it from introversion). For instance:

        ENTJ: extraversion (E), intuition (N), thinking (T), judgment (J)
        ISFP: introversion (I), sensing (S), feeling (F), perception (P)      
        
        It is worth noting, that studies since have shown as each question has been broken down to introvert vs extrovert, this quite polarising and the distribution of results
        can be quite skewed in this regard as many people will show a high relation to both extrovert and introvert in much of the answers.
